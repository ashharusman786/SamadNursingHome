## Action Required: Please Install Project Dependencies

Hello! I'm ready to start working on your project, but I've run into a limitation with my current toolset. I'm unable to run the `npm install` command myself to install the necessary dependencies for the project.

**Could you please run the following command in the root directory of the project?**

```bash
npm install
```

Once the command has finished successfully, please let me know, and I will continue with the audit and optimization of your project.

Thank you for your help!
